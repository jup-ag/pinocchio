/// Declare the program entrypoint.
///
/// This entrypoint is defined as *lazy* because it does not read the accounts upfront.
/// Instead, it provides an [`InstructionContext`] to the access input information on demand.
/// This is useful when the program needs more control over the compute units it uses.
/// The trade-off is that the program is responsible for managing potential duplicated
/// accounts and set up a `global allocator` and `panic handler`.
///
/// The usual use-case for a [`lazy_program_entrypoint!`] is small programs with a single
/// instruction. For most use-cases, it is recommended to use the [`crate::program_entrypoint!`]
/// macro instead.
///
/// This macro emits the boilerplate necessary to begin program execution, calling a
/// provided function to process the program instruction supplied by the runtime, and reporting
/// its result to the runtime. Note that it does not set up a global allocator nor a panic
/// handler.
///
/// The only argument is the name of a function with this type signature:
///
/// ```ignore
/// fn process_instruction(
///    mut context: InstructionContext, // wrapper around the input buffer
/// ) -> ProgramResult;
/// ```
///
/// # Example
///
/// Defining an entrypoint and making it conditional on the `bpf-entrypoint` feature. Although
/// the `entrypoint` module is written inline in this example, it is common to put it into its
/// own file.
///
/// ```no_run
